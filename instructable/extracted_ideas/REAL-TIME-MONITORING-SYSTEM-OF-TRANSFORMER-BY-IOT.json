        "description": "This project aims to monitor a working Transformer to detect faults quickly, using real-time monitoring of Transformer parts separately as monitoring a running transformer is difficult in real life. It focuses on determining the top oil temperature and hot spot temperature rise in the winding insulation system.",
        "steps": [
            "Start the Intel Edison board.",
            "Connect the Grove temperature sensor with the Edison board.",
            "Create a channel on Thingspeak (Cloud system).",
            "Write a program that will sense the temperature and send the data to Thingspeak.",
            "Use a mobile phone for WiFi hotspot.",
            "Burn the program on Edison.",
            "Take the transformer oil in an electrical workshop and use the insulation testing machine to spark it thrice.",
            "Measure the temperature of the oil.",
            "Send the data to the cloud (Thingspeak)."
