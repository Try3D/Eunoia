        "description": "This project is a multimeter workstation built from upcycled materials to hold and organize multimeters, making them easily accessible for electronics projects. It includes features like probe storage, a carrying handle, and the ability to be wall-mounted at an angle for better LCD readability.",
        "steps": [
            "Cut a piece of chipboard to 7 inches wide and to a height that accommodates the multimeters plus a lip.",
            "Cut two legs, each 3/4 inch wide and the same height as the board.",
            "Attach the legs to the board using grabber screws at the pivot point.",
            "Drill a hole near the top of the legs and attach a length of scrap cat-5 wire between them to create a carrying handle and wall hanger.",
            "Drill holes for the probes on the top and front of the board, positioned 1/4 and 3/4 inch in from both sides.",
            "Attach the multimeters to the board using self-adhesive velcro dots.",
            "Label one meter 'V' (volts) and the other 'A' (amps)."
