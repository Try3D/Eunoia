            "Connect the battery contacts to the leads of the solar cell. The spring contact is negative. Solder and heat shrink the connections for a better build, or use tightly twisted wire and tape.",
            "Insert the AA rechargeable battery into the clock.",
            "Wedge the solar lamp's battery contacts between the clock and its existing battery contacts.",
            "Mount the solar cell on the back of the clock with tape (or more permanent mounting).",
            "Hang the clock in a window with sufficient light to charge the battery."
