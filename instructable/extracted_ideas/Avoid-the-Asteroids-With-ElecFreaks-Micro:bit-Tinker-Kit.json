        "description": "This project involves creating a Raiden-esque game on the Micro:bit, where the player dodges incoming projectiles using the ADKeyboard as a controller. The game's difficulty increases over time as the projectiles speed up. The Micro:bit LED screen displays the game, and button B shows the high score.",
        "steps": [
            "Insert the Micro:bit into the breakout board and connect the ADKeyboard, ensuring the wire colors match the pin colors.",
            "Add the Tinkercademy package by pasting \"https://pxt.microbit.org/50544-64675-33322-24641\" into the 'Add Package' dialog box in the MakeCode editor.",
            "Initialize variables for score, highscore, and game state (alive, speed).",
            "Use button B to display the high score when the game is not running.",
            "Use button A to start the game, initialize the player and projectile sprites, and set the initial game state variables.",
            "Implement a while loop that continues as long as the player is alive.",
            "Within the loop, code the ADKeyboard controls: red A moves the player left, red B moves the player right, blue D stops the game.",
            "Code the projectile movement: randomly select a projectile to move upwards from the bottom row, and move existing projectiles upwards, returning them to the bottom row when they reach the top.",
            "Check for collisions between the player and projectiles. If a collision occurs, set 'alive' to False to end the game.",
            "Increment the score for each loop iteration.",
            "Increase the projectile speed every 15 points by decreasing the 'speed' variable.",
            "After the game ends, delete the sprites from the LED screen.",
            "Display 'Game Over' followed by the score. If the score is a new high score, update the highscore variable."
