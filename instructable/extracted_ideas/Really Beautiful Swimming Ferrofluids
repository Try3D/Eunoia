        "description": "This project describes how to create a stable and visually appealing ferrofluid display where the ferrofluid blob swims freely in a clear liquid, forms beautiful shapes with a magnet, and does not stick to the vessel.",
        "steps": [
            "Prepare the ferrofluid by heating it in a shallow dish on a hotplate at 100C until its weight is reduced by about 10% to increase its viscosity. This should be done in a well-ventilated area.",
            "Prepare the suspension solution by cleaning a glass container with a harsh cleaning solution until water runs off in sheets. Then, dissolve Kosher salt in distilled water until a saturated solution is achieved, with some undissolved salt remaining. Remove any undissolved salt and add a small percentage of distilled water.",
            "Prepare the glass vessel by thoroughly cleaning it. Consider baking it at 300C and soaking it in vinegar, followed by rinsing with distilled water. Pre-soak the vessel with the brine solution for a day or two before introducing the ferrofluid.",
            "Pour the brine solution into the prepared glass vessel, filling it to the top. Using a pipette, carefully transfer droplets of ferrofluid into the brine solution, ensuring the pipette tip is submerged. Seal the vessel with a small air bubble at the top."
