            "Create a set using paper, paint, and sand to represent a town called 'Crooks'. The buildings are made from black, white, and gray paper. The water is painted and the beach is made from sand.",
            "Plan the scene and characters for the movie.",
            "Create characters for the scene.",
            "Practice the scene to refine the animation.",
            "Film the stop-motion video by taking pictures after slightly moving the characters.",
            "Combine all the still images into a video using video editing software and add sound effects to complete the final product."
