        "description": "This project demonstrates how to control lights using gestures detected by The Tactigon board, which communicates with a Raspberry Pi 3 via Bluetooth Low Energy. The Raspberry Pi then controls a 4-channel relay board to switch lights on and off based on the recognized gestures.",
        "steps": [
            "Connect the 4-channel relay module to the Raspberry Pi 3 using jumper cables, connecting specific pins for control signals (7, 11, 13, 15) and power (4 and 6 for 5V and GND).",
            "Connect lamps to the output terminals of the relay board, interrupting the phase wire and connecting it through the relay's C and NO (normally open) terminals, ensuring appropriate electrical safety measures.",
            "Install Raspbian Stretch operating system on the Raspberry Pi's microSD card and update it.",
            "Install the latest version of BlueZ for Bluetooth Low Energy communication and enable experimental features by modifying the bluetooth.service file.",
            "Install the bluepy library for Python using pip, along with necessary support libraries.",
            "Write a Python script on the Raspberry Pi to handle Bluetooth Low Energy notifications from The Tactigon, process the received data, and control the GPIO pins connected to the relay board.",
            "Upload the appropriate Arduino sketch to The Tactigon board to analyze its position and send corresponding messages via Bluetooth Low Energy to the Raspberry Pi."
