            "Pull lever 1 to extrude yellow Sculpty polymer clay into a hexagonal shape around the lead, using the architectural lead holder to center the lead. Cut both ends when the clay reaches the lead holder.",
            "Lift lever 2 to drop the clay-wrapped graphite stick onto a hand-cranked, heat-proof conveyor belt.",
            "Crank the belt, guiding the pencil under a rubber stamp.",
            "Stamp the pencil by depressing lever 3, and crank the belt further to move the pencil into an overturned toaster.",
            "Depress lever 4 to activate the toaster oven for one minute.",
            "Crank the belt further until the pencil falls onto a cooling rack. Cool for one minute.",
            "Die-cut an eraser from a block of rubber and fit it to the pencil end using a half-inch strip of aluminum tape."
