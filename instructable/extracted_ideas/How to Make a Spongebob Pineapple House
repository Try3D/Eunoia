        "description": "This project involves designing and building a scaled prototype of Spongebob's pineapple house as a prop for a play. The house is made out of cardboard and foam, featuring pyramid tessellation shapes and an internal LED circuit powered by a 9V battery.",
        "steps": [
            "Construct the base by cutting a wooden circle to fit snugly inside the cardboard core and sanding the edges.",
            "Cut out 120 isosceles triangles from cardboard to create 40 pyramids. Glue the edges of three triangles together to form each pyramid.",
            "Glue the pyramid shapes onto the cardboard core, starting at the top or bottom and leaving space for the door, window, and switch.",
            "Build a parallel circuit with the 5 LEDs, a switch, and a 100 OHM resistor on a breadboard first to ensure proper functionality. Solder the circuit to the correct wire lengths to allow easy incorporation.",
            "Solder braided wires to the resistor and LED anodes, then connect them in parallel. Connect the cathodes and battery to complete the circuit.",
            "Cut the door, window, and exhaust from foam using a foam cutter. Shape the door as a semi-oval, the window as a circle, and the exhaust from two cylinders glued at a right angle.",
            "Paint the accessories black and the pineapple orange. Allow the paint to dry overnight before assembly.",
            "Glue the door, window, and exhaust to the pineapple core in their respective positions.",
            "Drill holes for the LEDs and insert them. Place the battery inside and position the switch for easy access.",
            "Add the fake leaves to the top of the pineapple. Optionally, add green paint to the pyramid tips for a more realistic pineapple look."
