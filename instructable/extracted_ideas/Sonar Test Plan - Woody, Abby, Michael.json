        "description": "The goal of this test plan is to see if we can measure distance using a sonar. This project provides instructions on how to build a simple digital ultrasonic sensor, calibrate it, program it, and use it to measure the distance from one point to another. The project also includes using LEDs to indicate when the distance meets certain thresholds.",
        "steps": [
            "Assemble the Arduino board by connecting vcc to ground, trig to pin 9, echo to pin 10, and ground to 5V on the breadboard. Connect the blue LED to pin 11 and the yellow LED to pin 8.",
            "In the Arduino code, within the void setup() function, initialize pins 9 and 10, setting TRIG as OUTPUT and ECHO as INPUT using PINMODE(). Include Serial.begin(9600);.",
            "In the void loop() function, send a LOW signal from the output pin using digitalWrite() for 2 microseconds, then send a HIGH signal for 10 microseconds. Create a float variable called 'duration' to store the time it takes for the sound signal to be sent and received, using duration = pulseIn(ECHO, HIGH);. Print this value using Serial.print().",
            "Calibrate the sonar by taking 10 distance measurements with a ruler and recording the corresponding sonar readings on the computer. Use data analysis software (e.g., LoggerPro) to generate a line of best fit and its equation. Convert the duration values to distance values in your code using this equation. Set up a variable for distance and display it using Serial.println().",
            "Place two LEDs on the breadboard, connecting them to pins 9 and 10. Record the color and pin connection of each LED for coding.",
            "In the code, initialize the LED pins (9 and 10) as OUTPUT. Use if/then statements to set up parameters for when each LED should turn on or off, based on distance thresholds. Use digitalWrite() to control the LEDs.",
            "Place the sonar in front of a door so it can measure its distance when open and closed. Measure the distance of the door when fully closed. Enter this measurement into the code as a parameter for signaling the LEDs. Configure one LED to light when the door is closed and the other when the door is open."
