        "description": "This project demonstrates the contrast illusion, a visual phenomenon where the perception of an object's brightness or color is altered by the surrounding environment. This illusion highlights how our brains interpret visual information and can lead to distorted perceptions of private signs, breaking usual stereotypes, and re-evaluating conventional features.",
        "steps": [
            "Observe the optical illusion of paper.",
            "Note how the perception of grey diamonds of the same brightness appear different due to the contrast illusion.",
            "Consider how contrast illusions occur when breaking the usual stereotypes, which manifests itself in the re-evaluation features, opposite conventional",
            "Understand that optical illusions (visual illusions) are errors in visual perception caused by the inaccuracy or inadequacy of the processes unconscious correction of the visual image, as well as physical causes.",
            "Reflect on how the observer consciously or unconsciously makes factually inaccurate explanation for the observed pattern to them."
