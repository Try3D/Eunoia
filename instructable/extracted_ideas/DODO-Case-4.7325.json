        "steps": [
            "Cut two holes on each side of the DODO Case, equal distances from the back, using a craft knife, ensuring they are wide and tall enough for the elastic band.",
            "Thread one end of the elastic band through one hole, and use hot glue to attach the end to itself, creating a loop. Repeat on the other side, ensuring the band fits your head. Test the fit after the glue dries.",
            "Place the foam piece where your nose goes on the DODO Case. Adjust for comfort, then hot glue the foam in place after you are satisfied.",
            "Insert the earbuds into the case with the speakers facing the lenses. Pull the wire connecting the earbuds up against the black piece in the middle of the case and hot glue the ear buds to the bottom of the case and nose piece.",
            "Mark the headband slightly in front of your ears. Align the ends of the ear buds with these marks, ensuring the speakers hang about an inch below the headband. Hot glue the ear buds in this position on the outside of the headband on both sides.",
            "Coil any excess earbud wire on the bottom of the case, close to the lens, and secure it with tape, ensuring the lens remains unobstructed. Test the fit with a device."
