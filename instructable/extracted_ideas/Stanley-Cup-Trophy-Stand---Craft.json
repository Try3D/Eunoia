        "description": "This project explains how to create a Stanley Cup trophy stand with foam core, for those who don't have access to a 3D printer. The stand will have an opening on the top to place the trophy.",
        "steps": [
            "Measure and mark lines on the foam core to create the top (70mm x 50mm), side walls (70mm x 20mm, two pieces), end walls (70mm x 20mm, two pieces which will be trimmed to 40mm x 20mm), and support sections.",
            "Cut 4 support pieces from a 70mm x 20mm foam core piece, each 5mm wide and 20mm long.",
            "Trim two of the 70mm x 20mm pieces down to 40mm x 20mm to create the end boards.",
            "Create a 30mm diameter circle opening in the center of the top piece (70mm x 50mm) using a compass and X-Acto knife.",
            "Glue the four support pieces to the bottom of the circle at equal distances from each other.",
            "Glue the tops of the support posts, with the circle attached, to the bottom of the large foam core top section, ensuring that the supports do not obstruct the opening.",
            "Glue the side walls and end walls to the top piece to form the stand's box shape.",
            "Cut a small 5mm x 5mm opening on the end wall opposite the stand opening for wires, if needed.",
            "Test the fit of the trophy in the opening and make any necessary adjustments."
