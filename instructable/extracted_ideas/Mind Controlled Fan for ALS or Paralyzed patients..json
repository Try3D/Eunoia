        "description": "This project demonstrates how to control a fan using brainwaves for ALS or paralyzed patients. It involves modifying a Mindflex toy headset, integrating it with a Bluetooth module, and using Arduino and Processing to control a fan based on EEG data.",
        "steps": [
            "Modify the Mindflex headset by opening the side with the switch, removing the circuit board, and soldering three wires to the T (Transmit) pin, GND (ground), and VCC (Power) on the chip.",
            "Connect the soldered wires to the RXD, GND, and VCC of the Bluetooth module, insulate the connections, and fix the Bluetooth module to the headset.",
            "Pair the Bluetooth module with the computer following instructions specific to your operating system.",
            "Download and unzip BrainWaveOSC, then configure the settings.xml file with the correct COM port for the Bluetooth device (Windows) or equivalent on other OS.",
            "Run BrainWaveOSC and verify that it's receiving data from the headset (left panel turns green).",
            "Download and install Processing. Create a new sketch and import the OSC library.",
            "Create setup() and draw() functions in Processing to set up the basic structure.",
            "Initialize oscP5 to listen on the OSC port specified in BrainWaveOSC (typically 7771).",
            "Create an oscEvent() function to receive OSC messages and print the address pattern and typetag to the console for debugging.",
            "Inside the oscEvent() function, check for the \"/attention\" address pattern and extract the attention value.",
            "Create a global variable to store the current attention value, and update this variable within the oscEvent() function when a new attention value is received.",
            "Connect the Arduino to your computer and determine the port number.",
            "Send the attention values from Processing to the Arduino via the serial port.",
            "Write an Arduino sketch to read the attention values sent from Processing.",
            "Connect the fan to an Arduino pin and set a threshold value for the attention level to trigger the fan to switch on and off."
