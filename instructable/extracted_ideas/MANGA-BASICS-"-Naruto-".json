        "steps": [
            "Start with drawing an oval shape and lining it in the middle to make it easier to draw the face.",
            "Draw two horizontal lines with 2-3 cm space between each, and one line spaced about 4 cm from the bottom of the oval.",
            "Draw an eye between the two lines in the middle to help you draw the visible two eyes one on the right and one on the left.",
            "Draw hair, eyebrows, ears, and some facial details. A spiky hairstyle, typical for Naruto, is suggested. Use the two horizontal lines as guides for the ears. Add three lines on his face for his signature scars.",
            "Draw a rectangle shape between the brows and the hair for his hairband, then draw the logo on it. Draw the neck by linking dots from the center of each eye down past the jawline. Draw a rounded high neck shirt, resembling an unclosed oval shape under the jaw.",
            "Remove all the basic lines used for measuring. Use a black pen or sharp dark pencil (BH, BH1, or BH2) to redefine the blurred lines and set the details.",
            "Before coloring, identify where the shadows are located. Add shadows smoothly to make the drawing more realistic. Observe the drawing under a clear light to accurately place the shadows, and then you may proceed with the coloring of the figure."
